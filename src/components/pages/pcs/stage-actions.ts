// The role-gated stage rail. The SET of transition targets comes only from the

// each legal target to a labelled button and decides VISIBILITY per role so the
// client only ever sees Approve / Reject, and the agency side sees Approve /
// Reject (on the client's behalf) plus Park / Send-or-move to review. This
// mirrors the server exactly: it never surfaces a button the stage_transition
// proc would reject. Pure, unit-tested.
