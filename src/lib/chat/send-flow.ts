// The send orchestration, Postgres first: record the message through
// chat_message_send, and only once the row exists publish it over Agora for
// live delivery. Pure of React and of the SDK (both steps are injected) so the
// contract is unit-tested directly: the record write always precedes the live
// publish, the rendered message carries the RETURNED row's server created_at,
// a live publish failure or a publish slower than LIVE_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT_MS never
// fails the send (the row exists; receivers catch up from Postgres), and a
// record failure or timeout reports 'failed' with its class (send-errors.ts).
//
// createOutboxSender runs those sends in the background, one channel queue at a
// time (FIFO per channel: a later message never records before an earlier
// pending one). A transient failure (network, timeout, 408 / 429 / 5xx, an
// upload error or stall) never shows: the bubble keeps its clock and the
// attempt repeats with backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, then every 30s, with no end;
// a backoff attempt is skipped while the device is offline) using the SAME
// message id and a fresh trace id per attempt; kick() (reconnect, tab
// visible, online) retries at once. Only a permanent failure (the server
// refused this message) turns the bubble 'failed' ("Not sent" + Retry); the
// queue then moves on to the next message, and Retry re-stamps the refused
// one (it moves to the bottom) and puts it back in line. A recorded send
// re-stamps the sends queued behind it to just after its server time, so
// they never show above it.
//
// Instant attachment sends: an entry may carry picked files or a recorded voice
// note (attachment.local) whose asset id is still ''. Each attempt first
// uploads those, in order and one at a time, reporting progress as 'progress'
// events, and stores every returned version id on the entry; only then does it
// record once with all the ids. A
// retry uploads only the files that still have no version id. An entry
// restored while its files are read back (restoring) holds its place without
// running; one whose files are gone (filesMissing) never runs and does not
// hold up the queue.
//
// Cancel (the X on an uploading bubble): each entry owns one AbortController
// whose signal rides every upload of it. cancel() aborts the in-flight request,
// skips the uploads still to run, drops the entry (its stored files and
// previews go through onCancelled), clears its backoff timer and frees the
// lane at once, so the next queued send starts now. A cancelled upload's
// answer is ignored: never "Not sent", a retry or a backoff. The record call is
// the point of no return: deliver checks for a cancel synchronously right
// before it, and once it has fired a cancel is ignored and the bubble stays.
// Files already uploaded for a cancelled message stay as orphan assets.
//
// Mentions ride in the body as @[uuid] tokens; every attempt derives p_mentions
// from the body, so a retry (or a send restored from storage) resends them.
// When the server refuses a mention ('mentioned people must be in this chat')
// the attempt re-reads the chat's members once and records again without the
// ones who left (without any mention when that re-read fails): never a failed
// bubble for it.
