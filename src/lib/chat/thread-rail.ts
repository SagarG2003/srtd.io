// iMessage-style threads for post-card replies, pure. A reply belongs to a
// thread when its thread root (chat_messages.thread_root_message_id, set by
// the record's trigger) is a post card message: those rows draw a rail
// instead of a quote or KEY chip. Replies whose root is a plain message keep
// their quote. Membership is decided once, when a row first goes on screen,
// and never changes look later because a root resolved (only a root's delete
// turns its members back into plain quotes). The rail only spans a contiguous
// run of members; a non-member row, a day pill or the unread divider ends a
// run, and the next member starts a new run headed by a chip. Counts come from
// loaded rows when the root is loaded (loaded history is contiguous back to
// the oldest page), else from one chat_thread_reply_counts call per page.
// Framework-free, so every rule is unit-tested without a DOM.
